<h1 align="center">README Generator</h1> 
  

## Description
 #
Every project needs a quality README with information about the app - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project.
 
## Installation
#

To generate your own README.md git clone the repo down to your local computer so you have the Node project.
Run
```
npm init -y
npm i inquirer 
 ```

the application will start by running 
```
node index.mjs.
```

Answer the prompts in your command line according to what you want to include in your README file. If you leave a section blank it won't be listed in the table of contents section.
